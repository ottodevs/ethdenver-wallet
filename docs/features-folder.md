Here's a detailed breakdown of the recommended `features/` folder structure, clearly explaining each subfolder’s responsibility, file types, and contents.

# 📁 `features/` Folder Structure (Detailed)

The goal of this structure is modularity, clarity, and ease of scaling.

## General Structure

```
src/features/
├── auth/
├── wallet/
├── chatbot/
├── assets/
├── transactions/
└── shared/
```

---

## 1. 📂 `auth/`

**Responsibility:** Manages all authentication logic (NextAuth, OAuth, sessions).

```
auth/
├── components/          # Auth-specific UI components
│   └── signin-button.tsx
├── hooks/               # Auth-related React hooks
│   └── use-session.ts
├── services/            # Auth logic, sessions handling, API calls (optional)
│   └── auth-service.ts
├── config/              # NextAuth configuration
│   └── nextauth-config.ts
└── types/               # Type definitions (NextAuth types)
    └── next-auth.d.ts
```

---

## 📁 `wallet/`

Manages user wallet functionalities like balances, sending tokens, receiving, and swapping.

```
wallet/
├── components/           # Wallet-specific UI pieces
│   ├── wallet-header.tsx
│   ├── action-buttons.tsx
│   ├── balance-display.tsx
│   └── wallet-dashboard.tsx
├── hooks/                # Wallet state & actions hooks
│   ├── use-wallet.ts
│   └── use-privacy-mode.tsx
├── services/             # Wallet logic, transactions, delegation logic
│   ├── wallet-service.ts
│   └── delegated-transfer-service.ts
└── types.ts              # Types specific to wallet domain
```

---

## 🤖 `chatbot/` (previously `ai`)

Contains functionality related to AI-powered chat and LLM integration:

```
chatbot/
├── components/           # Chat UI & visualization
│   ├── ai-chatbox.tsx
│   ├── ai-chat-history.tsx
│   ├── ai-chat-input.tsx
│   ├── markdown.tsx
│   └── fear-greed-chart.tsx
├── hooks/                # Chat-specific hooks
│   ├── use-chatbot.ts
│   └── use-ai-service.ts
├── services/             # API interaction with LLM/chat backend
│   ├── ai-service.ts
│   └── fear-greed-service.ts
└── types.ts              # Chatbot-related type definitions
```

---

## 📦 `assets/` (merging NFTs & Tokens)

Unified asset management for NFTs and crypto tokens:

```
assets/
├── components/
│   ├── nft-gallery.tsx
│   ├── token-list.tsx
│   └── token-selector.tsx
├── hooks/                # Asset management hooks
│   ├── use-nfts.ts
│   └── use-tokens.ts
├── services/             # Token & NFT APIs, transfers, consolidations
│   ├── nft-service.ts
│   ├── token-service.ts
│   └── token-transfer-service.ts
└── types.ts              # Shared types (tokens, NFTs, balances, etc.)
```

---

## 🔄 `transactions/`

For transaction history and related functionality:

```
transactions/
├── components/
│   └── transaction-history.tsx
├── hooks/
│   └── use-transactions.ts
├── services/
│   └── transactions-service.ts
└── types.ts
```

---

## ♻️ `shared/`

Reusable logic, hooks, and generic utilities or services across multiple features.

```
shared/
├── components/             # Global shared UI or wrappers
│   ├── loading-screen.tsx
│   ├── error-boundary.tsx
│   └── responsive-dialog.tsx
├── hooks/                 # Common hooks reused everywhere
│   ├── use-copy-to-clipboard.ts
│   └── use-media-query.ts
├── services/             # Cross-cutting services (chain info, global state)
│   └── chain-service.ts
├── state/                # Global app state if needed (zustand, jotai)
│   ├── account-state.ts
│   └── app-state.ts
└── types.ts               # Shared types across multiple domains
```

> **Note:** Avoid excessive files here—only include truly reusable items.

## 📚 Best practices for each feature module:

Each feature should be:

- ✅ **Self-contained**:
    - Each folder encapsulates logic, services, hooks, and UI components relevant **only to that domain**.
- ✅ **Independent Testing**:
    - Unit and integration tests per-feature.
    - Services and hooks should have clear interfaces for mocking during tests.
- ✅ **Explicit Dependency**:
    - A feature folder should only depend on the global `lib/` utilities or other clearly defined shared modules, never directly importing logic from sibling features.

---

## 📦 Example of good separation of concerns:

- Components are purely presentational or smart UI wrappers (e.g., `wallet-header.tsx`, `ai-chatbox.tsx`).
- Hooks encapsulate state management and side effects clearly.
- Services handle business logic and data fetching separately.

---

## ⚠️ Recommendations & Quick Wins for Refactoring

- **Immediately merge NFTs & Tokens into `assets/`.**
- **Rename `ai` to `chatbot`** for clarity.
- **Extract common hooks/services from multiple components into clearly named hooks/services in `shared`.**

---

## 🛠 Final Recommended Approach for your engineers:

- Use the structure above as reference and adapt incrementally, starting with highest-value features.
- Keep structure flat enough initially (avoid premature nesting) and only introduce complexity as strictly necessary.

---

## ✅ Final Proposed `features/` Structure

```
features/
├── auth/
├── wallet/
├── chatbot/
├── assets/          # combined NFTs & Tokens
├── transactions/
└── shared/
```

This simplified yet powerful approach ensures modularity, clear domains, maintainability, and future-proofing your blockchain app's codebase.
